A Laravel package for chaos engineering that deletes random files at random times. Use this to test your application's resilience against data loss or file system corruption.

> [!WARNING]
> **This package deletes files.** Do not use this in production unless you are absolutely sure what you are doing and have backups.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require laravel-chaos/testing
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="laravel-chaos-testing-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Chaos Enabled
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | This option controls whether the chaos command is enabled.
    | It is recommended to keep this disabled in production unless you
    | really know what you are doing.
    |
    */
    'enabled' => env('CHAOS_ENABLED', false),

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Target Paths
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The paths where the chaos command will look for files to delete.
    |
    */
    'paths' => [
        storage_path('logs'),
    ],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Target Extensions
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | If specified, only files with these extensions will be deleted.
    | Leave empty to target all files.
    |
    */
    'extensions' => [],

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Filesystem Disk
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | The filesystem disk to use.
    |
    */
    'disk' => 'local',
];
```

## Usage

Once installed and enabled, the package registers a scheduled command `chaos:process` that runs hourly.

The command checks if it's time to "unleash chaos" based on a random schedule (once per week). If it is time, it will pick a random file from your configured `paths` and delete it.

You can also run the command manually:

```bash
php artisan chaos:process
```

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
